# SmartPDF - Intelligent Document Processing with RAG

A smart PDF processing system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to make documents searchable and queryable through semantic search.

## What I'm Building

**SmartPDF** is designed to solve the problem of finding specific information across large collections of PDF documents. Instead of manually searching through dozens of files, users can ask natural language questions and get precise answers with source references.

## The Vision

- **Upload PDFs**: Users can upload their PDF documents to the system
- **Smart Parsing**: The system extracts and chunks text content intelligently
- **Vector Search**: Documents are converted into searchable embeddings using FastEmbed
- **Semantic Queries**: Ask questions like "What are the payment terms?" instead of keyword searching
- **Source Attribution**: Every answer shows exactly which document and page it came from

## Core Technologies

- **FastEmbed**: For generating high-quality text embeddings
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic similarity search
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Backend API development
- **Express**: REST API framework
- **PDF Processing**: Text extraction and intelligent chunking

## Use Cases

- **Legal Professionals**: Search through contracts, briefs, and case documents
- **Researchers**: Query academic papers and research documents
- **Business Analysts**: Find insights across reports and documentation
- **Students**: Search through textbooks and study materials
- **Consultants**: Organize and query client documents

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Building the core RAG pipeline with modular architecture for scalability.

## Goals

Create a system where finding information in documents is as easy as asking a question.
